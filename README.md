# Exploring Flutter widgets

This project is just a playground for a Medium series that I am working on that explores different Flutter widgets.
Feel free to go through the code or raise PRs if you feel like something could be better.
Also, note I will not be going through the basic APIs of any widgets, But I will make sure that I go through all the important APIs in every widget possible.
